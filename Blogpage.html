        Mohamad Khechen who is the founder of this amzing place in life Camp Abuja .<br> Mohamad Khechenis a Nigerian-Lebanese art collector fond of contemporary African art who took a step further by establishing an art gallery in Abuja. 
        We have had the pleasure to visit mutiple times and its like your coming into a new building beacause the art works are regulary changed with mutiple
        exhibtions from famous artist around the World. It is truly amazing and we can only wish for more establishing of other Art structures like this in the near future. 
      We saw some works going for 200 dollars and some going for up to 50 Thousand dollars, If your in abuja and ready to visit a gallery  please this should 
    be the very first on your list      </p>

            take some time to get to you but its all worth it. The layout of the food is just amazing , one of the best we have seen 
          for Nigerian Breakfast which actually properly fills you up. The are afforable well depends on who you are but roughly from   6 thousand upwords.
        It is a very relaxing setting featuring an outdoor garden like place with little books all around. In general it is a really beatiful place with 
      amazing meal layout , delicious and properly filling so yes we would go with brunch club    </p>

          now what is  really amzing about this place and why we picked it for our hidden germ is the fact that many people dont know of it but Hope Eden Basically you can rent 
        a Hut on there Farm and oh not just a regular hut but a modernized one with a beatiful peaceful bed and secenery which has a night view to live for you just have to see it to understand . The has various 
      rooms depending on your budget and you get to enjoy breakfast with the host who are a lovely German couple with crazy stories and welcoming artitudes. Pricing goes for about 6 thousand a night and you will pay extra for feeding 
    which to me very afforable for its a place to cool your mind from the city life.  </p>
